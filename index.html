    <h2>Welcome 💖</h2>
    <p>In the spring of 2025, I joined <strong>Sand Rarity</strong> as a sales assistant intern in their pop-up store located in <em>Galeries Lafayette Reims</em>. Over two months, under the guidance of <strong>Sandy BOGET</strong>, I immersed myself in luxury customer service, product knowledge, and experiential selling. This experience taught me how to communicate effectively, develop product passion, and work as part of a boutique team.</p>

    <h2>Critical Thinking 🧠</h2>
    <p>Prior to my internship, I believed that start-ups were chaotic and lacked structure. Sand Rarity proved me wrong.
